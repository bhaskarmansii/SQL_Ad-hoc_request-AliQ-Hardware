# SQL_Ad-hoc_request-AliQ-Hardware

This project is a part of another Code Basics Challenge, where the goal was to provide critical insights to the management of Atliq Hardware, a prominent computer hardware producer operating in India and several other countries. The management recognized the need for data-driven decision-making but lacked the necessary insights. Task was to run SQL queries to address ten ad hoc requests and empower the management with actionable information. The ad hoc requests covered a range of topics, from identifying top-selling products and customer segments to optimizing inventory management and forecasting future sales trends.
